# Tanahku App

## Soil Type Classification and Crop Recommendations

The app includes a feature for soil type classification and crop recommendations. With this feature, users can input information about their soil type, and the app will provide recommendations for suitable crops to grow based on that soil type. This helps users make informed decisions about which crops are best suited for their specific soil conditions, optimizing their agricultural practices and increasing their chances of a successful harvest.

The app utilizes a comprehensive database of soil types and their associated crop preferences. It takes into account factors such as soil pH, texture, fertility, and drainage to provide accurate and tailored recommendations. Users can also access detailed information about each recommended crop, including planting instructions, growth requirements, and potential yield.

By providing this feature, the app aims to assist farmers and gardeners in maximizing their productivity and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices.
